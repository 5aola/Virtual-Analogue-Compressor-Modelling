# Virtual Analogue Modelling of a Compressor

## Deliverables

1. Gather a subset of the dataset of Diff-SSL for experimenting
2. Extract gain reduction
3. Test models/do small trainings
    - TCN
    - GCN
    - LSTM
    - ED
    - S6 ??
    - conditioning: FILM
4. Optimize models
5. Improve Loss function
6. Evaluate on bigger datasets and compare with other models
